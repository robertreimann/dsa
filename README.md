# Data structures, algorithms and other fun stuff

The purpose of this repository is write down my standard approach to common algorithms, data structures and techniques such as finding the leaves on a tree or implementing binary search.

 Having a common way of doing things is helpful in time constrained environments where you do not want to be going over your binary search algorithm and having to verify if by using inclusive comparison you will get a off by one error.

 The implementations I use are not necessarily better than others but they are what I find intuitive and they are also a good way to force yourself to make a conscious decision on *how* you implement your algorithms.
