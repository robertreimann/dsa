# Data structures, algorithms and other fun stuff

The purpose of this repository is write down my standard approach to common algorithm patterns, data structures and techniques such as finding the leaves on a tree when using an adjacency list or implementing binary search.

 Having a common way of doing things is helpful in time constrained environments where you do not want to be going over your binary search algorithm and having to verify if by using inclusive comparison you will get a off by one error.

 The implementations I use are not necessarily better than others but writing down my implementation style is a good way to force myself to make a conscious decision on what my style even is and just do stuff on autopilot instead of having to think about stuff like how I will check whether current node is in bounds when doing bfs on a matrix.

 Abstracting away lower level implementation details this way leaves more time for thinking about the higher level solution, this is called [Automaticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automaticity).
